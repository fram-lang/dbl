(** Main module for reporting errors *)

(** Fatal error, that aborts compilation *)
exception Fatal_error

(** Class of the error *)
type error_class =
  | FatalError
    (** Error that immediately aborts compilation *)

  | Error
    (** Regular error. Compilation will be aborted at the end of the phase. *)

  | Warning
    (** Warning. Does not abort the compilation. *)

  | Note
    (** Just note. *)

(** Report the error *)
val report : ?pos:Position.t -> cls:error_class -> string -> unit

(** Abort compilation if any error was reported. Should be called at the end
  of each phase. *)
val assert_no_error : unit -> unit

(** Wrap REPL continuation around additional call of [assert_no_error]. This
  function should be used in transforming REPL continuations (e.g. those
  stored in [Surface.ERepl]) in each phase that may raise an error. *)
val wrap_repl_cont : (unit -> 'a) -> unit -> 'a

(** Reset state of reported errors. Used in REPL in case of an error. *)
val reset : unit -> unit
