(** Server state *)

(** The LSP client claims ownership of files edited by the user (by sending
  a `textDocument/didOpen` notification). That means the content of the file
  is managed by the client and shouldn't be read from disk because the user
  might not have saved it yet. The client informs us of the changes in the file
  with a `textDocument/didChange` notification. We keep our own copy of
  the file in a temporary location and update it based on those notifications.
  The file is closed with a `textDocument/didClose` notification.

  Note from the spec: a serverâ€™s ability to fulfill requests is independent
    of whether a text document is open or closed.
