  metadata (proof) and constructors. The [nonrec_scope] parameter is a scope
  not extended with (mutually-)recursive definitions, and is used to check if
  a type is strictly positively recursive. Note that during type inference,
  the type is considered as strictly positively recursive if it does not
  contain type variables on non-strictly positive position or unification
  variables that do not fit in this scope. This approach may lead to some
  false-negatives, if the programmer omit some types that do not contain any
  recursive occurrences, e.g.,
  [ data rec T = C of (_ -> T) in ... C (fn (x : Int) => ...) ]. *)
