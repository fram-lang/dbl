(** Unfortunately, OCaml does not support mutually recursive modules defined
  in several files. For this reason, some functions of the type-checker takes
  as a parameter a module with mutually recursive functions. The variant of
  these functions with this additional module parameter can be defined in
  separate modules, but at some point, they should be packed into single
  recursive module, passed as the first parameter for them. See
  [TypeInference.Main] for this recursive definition. *)
